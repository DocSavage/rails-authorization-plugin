Description:
    The role_model generator creates a Role model for use with the Authorization plugin.

    The generator takes a model name as its argument, which at this time must be 'Role'.

    The generator creates a Role model class in app/models, a test suite in
    test/unit, test fixtures in test/fixtures/roles.yml, and a migration
    in the db/migrate directory.

Example:
    ./script/generate role_model Role

    This will create a Role model:
        Model:      app/models/role.rb
        Test:       test/unit/role_test.rb
        Fixtures:   test/fixtures/roles.yml
        Migration:  db/migrate/XXX_add_role.rb

    You should then run 'rake db:migrate'.
