= Authorization plugin

http://www.writertopia.com/developers/authorization

This plugin provides a flexible way to add authorization to Rails.

The authorization process decides whether a user is allowed access to some feature. 
It is distinct from the authentication process, which tries to confirm a user is 
authentic, not an imposter. There are many authentication systems available for Rails, 
e.g., acts_as_authenticated and LoginEngine. This authorization system 
will play nicely with them as long as some simple requirements are met:

1. User objects are available that implement a <tt>has_role?(role, authorizable_object = nil)</tt> method. This requirement can be easily handled by using <tt>acts_as_authorized_user</tt> in the User-like class.
   
2. If you want to use "role of model" authorization expressions, like "owner of resource" or "eligible for :award", then your models with roles must implement an <tt>accepts_role?(role, user)</tt> method. This requirement can be handled by using <tt>acts_as_authorizable</tt> in the model class.
   
The authorization plugin provides the following:
* A simple way of checking authorization at either the class or instance method level using #permit and #permit?
* Authorization using roles for the entire application, a model class, or an instance of a model (i.e., a particular object).
* Some english-like dynamic methods that draw on the defined roles. You will be able to use methods like "user.is_fan_of angelina" or "angelina.has_fans?", where a 'fan' is only defined in the roles table.
* Pick-and-choose a mixin for your desired level of database complexity. For all the features, you will want to use "object roles table" (see below)

== Steps in using the plugin

1. At the top of your config/environment.rb create an AUTHORIZATION_MIXIN constant and set it to "object roles" or "hardwired". (See init.rb in this plugin for how the role support is mixed in.)
2. Make sure your application provides a current_user method or something that returns the current user object. Add the constants in environment.rb to set your authentication system’s login page (DEFAULT_REDIRECTION_HASH) and method for storing the current URL for return after authentication (STORE_LOCATION_METHOD). (See authorization.rb in the plugin's /lib directory for the default values of DEFAULT_REDIRECTION_HASH and STORE_LOCATION_METHOD.)
3. If you use the "hardwired" mixin, no database use is required. Otherwise, you'll have to generate a role.rb model (and its associated join table with User) by running "script/generate role_model Role" and doing "rake migrate".
4. Add <tt>acts_as_authorized_user</tt> to your user class.
5. Add <tt>acts_as_authorizable</tt> to the models you want to query for roles.

== Jumpstarting with a mixin

The Authorization plugin comes with two modules that provide different levels of database support.
Each of the mixins provide the <tt>acts_as_authorized_user</tt> and <tt>acts_as_authorizable</tt> 
class methods for your models. If you use one of those declarations, you get methods that handle 
authorization with different database schemes. A full test web application is provided for each 
of the modules so you can see how they work. The "Object Roles Table" version is recommended for 
normal use and is the default.

=== 1) Hardwired Roles

This is the simplest and requires no database. Roles are assumed to be coded into the Model classes
using the <tt>has_role?(role, obj = nil)</tt> method.

=== 2) Object Roles Table

The Object Roles Table mixin provides full support for authorization expressions within a database by
add a polymorphic field to the Role table. Because roles have polymorphic associations to an
authorizable object, we can assign a user to a role for any model instance. So you could declare user X
to be a moderator for workshop Y, or you could make user A be the owner of resource B.

The identity module adds a number of dynamic methods that use defined roles. The user-like model
gets methods like <tt>user.is_moderator_of group</tt> (sets user to "moderator" of <tt>group</tt>),
<tt>user.is_moderator?</tt> (returns true/false if user has some role "moderator"), and
<tt>group.has_moderators</tt> (returns an array of users that have role "moderator" for the group).
If you prefer not to have these dynamic methods available, you can simply comment out the inclusion
of the identity module within object_roles_table.rb.

=== Migrations and Testing

Each mixin's test web application comes with migrations to set up the database for the associated mixin.
After reading the Rails Recipe on domain specific languages (DSLs) for testing, I added integration tests
for each mixin test app that use a simple vocabulary for testing authorization. The object_roles_test
application has the most tests. Please contribute tests to improve coverage.


== The Specifics

=== permit and permit?

permit and permit? take an authorization expression and a hash of options 
that typically includes any objects that need to be queried:

  permit <authorization expression> [, options hash ]
  permit? <authorization expression> [, options hash ]

The difference between permit and permit? is redirection. permit is a declarative 
statement and redirects by default. It can also be used as a class or an
instance method, gating the access to an entire controller in a before_filter fashion.

permit? is only an instance method, can be used within expressions, does not redirect by default.

The authorization expression is a boolean expression made up of permitted roles, prepositions,
and authorizable models. Examples include "admin" (User model assumed), "moderator of :workshop" 
(looks at options hash and then @workshop), "'top salesman' at :company" (multiword roles delimited 
by single quotes), or "scheduled for Exam" (queries class method of Exam).

Note that we can use several permitted prepositions ('of', 'for', 'in', 'on', 'to', 'at', 'by'). In the discussion below,
we assume you use the "of" preposition. You can modify the permitted prepositions by changing the constant
in Authorization::Base::Parser.

* If a specified role has no "of <model>" designation, we assume it is a user role (i.e., the model is the user-like object). 
* If an "of model" designation is given but no "model" key/value is supplied in the hash, we check if an instance variable @model if it's available.
* If the model is capitalized, we assume it's a class and query <tt>Model#self.accepts_role?</tt> (the class method) for the permission. (Currently only available in ObjectRolesTable mixin.)

For each role, a query is sent to the appropriate model object.

The grammar for the authorization expression is:

             <expr> ::= (<expr>) | not <expr> | <term> or <expr> | <term> and <expr> | <term>
             <term> ::= <role> | <role> <preposition> <model>
      <preposition> ::= of | for | in | on | to | at | by
            <model> ::= /:*\w+/
             <role> ::= /\w+/ | /'.*'/
		
Parentheses should be used to clarify permissions. Note that you may prefix the model with an optional ":" -- the first versions of Authorization plugin made this mandatory but it's now optional since the mandatory preposition makes models unambiguous.

==== Options

<tt>:allow_guests => false</tt>. We can allow permission processing without a current user object. The default is <tt>false</tt>.

<tt>:user</tt> => A <tt>user</tt> object.

<tt>:get_user_method => method</tt> that will return a <tt>user</tt> object. Default is <tt>#current_user</tt>, which is the how <tt>acts_as_authenticated</tt> works.

<tt>:only => [ :method1, :method2 ]</tt>. Array of methods to apply permit (not valid when used in instance methods)

<tt>:except => [ :method1, :method2 ]</tt>. Array of methods that won't have permission checking (not valid when used in instance methods)

<tt>:redirect => bool</tt>. default is <tt>true</tt>. If <tt>false</tt>, permit will not redirect to denied page.

<tt>:redirect_controller => controller</tt> that handles authorization failure (default is 'account')

<tt>:redirect_action => action</tt> that handles authorization failure (default is 'login')

<tt>:redirect_message => 'my message'</tt>. (default is 'Login is required')

=== Setting and getting the roles

Roles are set by #has_role and #accepts_role methods that are mixed into the User-like object 
and the authorizable models. User objects can set roles and optionally an object scope for
that role:

	user.has_role 'site_admin'
	user.has_role 'moderator', group
	user.has_no_role 'site_admin'
	user.has_no_role 'moderator', group
	user.has_role 'member', Group
	
Note that the last method sets role "member" on a class "Group". Roles can be set with three
scopes: entire application (no class or object specified), a model class, or an instance of a
model (i.e., a model object). 
	
Models set roles for specific users:

	a_model.accepts_role 'moderator', user
	a_model.accepts_no_role 'moderator', user
	Model.accepts_role 'class moderator', user

The method language has been chosen to aid memory of the argument order. A user has a role "foo",
so the role string immediately follows has_role. Similarly, a model accepts a role "foo", so
the role string immediately follows accepts_role. Then we append the scope.

Sometimes the user-like object might be an authorizable object as well, for example, when you 
allow 'friend' roles for users. In this case, the user-like object can be declared to be
<tt>acts_as_authorizable</tt> as well as <tt>acts_as_authorized_user</tt>.

Role queries follow the same pattern as the setting of roles:

    user.has_role? 'moderator'
    user.has_role? 'moderator', group
    user.has_role? 'member', Group
    
    a_model.accepts_role? 'moderator', user
    Model.accepts_role? 'moderator', user
  
When a user is queried without specifying either a model class or object, it returns true if the
user has *any* matching role. For example, <tt>user.has_role? 'moderator'</tt> returns true if
the user is 'moderator' of a class, a model object, or just a generic 'moderator'.
Note that if you say <tt>user.has_role 'moderator'</tt>, the user does not become 'moderator'
for all classes and model objects; the user simply has a generic role 'moderator'.

==== Dynamic methods through the Identity mixin

The Object Roles Table version includes some dynamic methods that use the roles table.
For example, if you have roles like "eligible", "moderator", and "owner", you'll be able to
use the following:

  user.is_eligible_for_what   --> returns array of authorizable objects for which user has role "eligible"
  user.is_moderator_of? group --> returns true/false
  user.is_moderator_of group  --> sets user to have role "moderator" for object group.
  user.is_administrator       --> sets user to have role "administrator" not really tied to any object.

Models get has_* methods:

  group.has_moderators  --> returns array of users with role "moderator" on that group
  group.has_moderators? --> returns true/false

Allowed prepositions are optional in the above dynamic methods. They are simply syntactic sugar.
For example, the following are equivalent:

  user.is_member_of group
  user.is_member_for group
  user.is_member group
  
Allowed prepositions are required in the authorization expressions because they are used to distinguish
"role" and "role of :model" and "role of Model".

If you prefer not to pollute your namespace with these dynamic methods, do not include the
Identity module in <tt>object_roles_table.rb</tt>.
  
=== Pattern of use

We expect the application to provide the following methods:

==== #current_user
Returns some user object, like an instance of my favorite class, <tt>UserFromMars</tt>. 
A <tt>user</tt> object, from the Authorization viewpoint, is simply an object that 
provides a <tt>has_role?</tt> method.

Note that duck typing means we don't care what else the <tt>UserFromMars</tt> might be doing. 
We only care that we can get an id from whatever it is, and we can check if a given 
role string is associated with it. By using <tt>acts_as_authorized_user</tt>, we inject what
we need into the user object.

If you use an authorization expression "admin of :foo", we check permission by 
asking <tt>foo</tt> if it <tt>accepts_role?('admin', user)</tt>. So for each model that is used in an 
expression, we assume that it provides the <tt>accepts_role?(role, user)</tt> method.

Note that <tt>user</tt> can be <tt>nil</tt> if <tt>:allow_guests => true</tt>. 

==== #store_return_location (optional)

This method will be called if authorization fails and the user is about to be redirected to 
the login action. This allows the application to return to the desired page after login.
If the application doesn't provide this method, the method will not be called.

The name of the method for storing a location can be modified by changing the constant 
STORE_LOCATION_METHOD in environment.rb. Also, the default login page is defined by the 
constant DEFAULT_REDIRECTION_HASH in authorization.rb and can be overriden in your environment.rb.

=== Conventions

Roles specified without the "of model" designation:

1. We see if there is a <tt>current_user</tt> method available that will return a user object. This method can be overridden with the <tt>:user</tt> hash.
2. Once a user object is determined, we pass the role to <tt>user.has_role?</tt> and expect a true return value if the user has the given role.

Roles specified with "of model" designation:

1. We attempt to query an object in the options hash that has a matching key. Example: <tt>permit "knight for justice", :justice => @abstract_idea</tt>
2. If there is no object with a matching key, we see if there's a matching instance variable. Example: @meeting defined before we use <tt>permit "moderator of meeting"</tt>
3. Once the model object is determined, we pass the role and user (determined in the manner above) to <tt>model.accepts_role?</tt>
