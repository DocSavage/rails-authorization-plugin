TO DO
+ Add Right model generator and DB-backed way of handling rights in addition to inlined "permit" checks
+ Added namespacing to @options instance variable to prevent possible name clashes
+ Add test generator instead of handling tests in test apps
+ Add support for groups
+ Extend grammar to allow "(admin or moderator or some_role) of some_model" (?) [Chris Hapgood]
+ Extend coverage to models. Look at Bruce Perens's ModelSecurity and access with_scope. (9/3006 - Recently investigated extension to model and the most programmer-friendly DSLs may require too much hacking on ActiveRecord.)

CHANGES (from most recent to oldest)

=== SVN

* Performance improvement for has_role?  [Sean Geoghegan]

* Allow customization of message on redirection after failed authorization (:redirect_message option) [Joey Geiger]

* Patch to allow authorizable objects that use single table inheritance (STI) [Sean Geoghegan]

=== 1.0 release (Sept 13, 2006)

* Added attr_protected for habtm and has_many role ids to block security concern if developers use update_attributes(params[:auth_obj]) on an authorizable object [Michael Schuerig]

* Use before_filter rather than prepend_before_filter so necessary instance variables (and methods) can be established before trying authorization checks. This fix came about for Mephisto blog where a class-level permit "admin of site" was used. The site attribute was set in a before_filter. If you prepend your authorization filter, it will execute before any other before_filter, which is probably not a good idea.

* Add "about" yaml for future Rails plugin directory.

* Cleaned up exception handling a little [due to suggestion by Michael Schuerig]

* Add generator for role model and migration, e.g., "script/generate role_model Role".
  Role model must be called "Role" at this time. More general naming as a TO DO.

* Removed simple_roles_table to simplify plugin.

* Moved all files in Authorization namespace into /publishare subdirectory
  to reduce danger of clashes in load path [nod to Michael Schuerig].

* Small code refinement patch [Michael Schuerig]

* The colon preceding a model name in the authorization expression is now optional. The parser uses accepted prepositions to disambiguate models from roles.

* Change default parser from Recursive Descent parser to Eval parser.
Currently implemented recursive descent parser doesn't handle left-sided
boolean expressions well. Eval parser relies on Ruby (good thing), but
wherever there's an eval, we have to be more careful.

* Will start linking to and monitoring forum area at RubyForge
http://rubyforge.org/forum/?group_id=1797

* Added changelog :)

* Added return false to handle_redirection to short-circuit filters if
redirect occurs. This is second fix to prevent double renders.

* Changed the requires to pull files from the plugin directory. (Necessary for name conflicts between plugin and apps)

* Minor fixes to update documentation

=== 1.0 rc3 (July 19, 2006)

* Fix to prevent double redirect

* Fix to migration examples
