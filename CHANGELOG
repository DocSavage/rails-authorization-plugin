CHANGES (from most recent to oldest)

* The colon preceding a model name in the authorization expression is now optional. The parser uses accepted prepositions to disambiguate models from roles.

* Change default parser from Recursive Descent parser to Eval parser.
Currently implemented recursive descent parser doesn't handle left-sided
boolean expressions well. Eval parser relies on Ruby (good thing), but
wherever there's an eval, we have to be more careful.

* Will start linking to and monitoring forum area at RubyForge
http://rubyforge.org/forum/?group_id=1797

* Added changelog :)

* Added return false to handle_redirection to short-circuit filters if
redirect occurs. This is second fix to prevent double renders.

* Changed the requires to pull files from the plugin directory. (Necessary for name conflicts between plugin and apps)

* Minor fixes to update documentation

=== 1.0 rc3 (July 19, 2006)
